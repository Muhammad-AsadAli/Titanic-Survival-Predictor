# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning task where we predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, class, etc.

It’s a classic classification problem often used as an intro to data science — and a great way to practice data cleaning, exploration, and model building!

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle’s Titanic competition], which includes details like:
- Passenger class
- Name, sex, and age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Fare paid
- Whether they survived (our target)
